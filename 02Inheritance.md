# Inheritance
In OOP, **inheritance** allows classes to have code reusability within programming

## Subclass
**Subclass** is the class which inherits from another class, also called a *child class* 

## Base Class
**Base class** is the class being inherited from, also called *parent class*

## Method Overriding
**Method overriding** is used to change what the method does. Within the subclass, we redefined the method (with the same name) to perform task differently

## super() method overrides
**super() method** is a method method that allows you to call a method from parent class
